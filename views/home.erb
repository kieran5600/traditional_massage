				<dd>"I've been going to Kieran for massage therapy work since 2009. Each experience has been hugely beneficial to my body and general well-being. I have a few problem areas that Kieran always asks about, and he provides healing attention to these trouble points. It's clear that Kieran is quite comfortable in his practice—during sessions, he adapts easily to your unique body, spending more time in areas that he can tell are tight, even if you hadn't been aware of it until that moment. The fact that Kieran travels to your home is an added advantage. After a session, you do not need to go anywhere or do anything. You can just relax in the comfort of your own home, reaping the benefits of the therapy. Kieran's focus on the whole body—the whole individual—is what keeps me coming back for more. Thank you, Kieran!"</dd>

		<p>Hello, I am Kieran Pierce and my massage therapy business is different than others, because I will travel to the client's home. There is no need to stress about making it to an appointment on time or driving after receiving a session when you are half asleep. Home visits allow the client to be able to relax, heal, and enjoy something wholesome for an extended period of time. I know how limited time can be in many people's lives and would love to provide a source of relaxation without the added stress. Whether you're an athlete, recoving from an injury, looking to relax, or simply enjoy the benefits of massage, my knowledge of bodywork is good for everyone, young and old alike.</p>

		<p>Learning that less is more, I provide a mat and a clean sheet for the client to lie upon. With the styles I practice, the client receives the massage in loose, comfortable clothing. The focus of my massages are on stretching, rhythmic rocking, muscle compression, Shiatsu points (see<a href="/styles"> Styles </a> page), and the specific physical concerns of each client. It is important to note that the client remains 100% relaxed while I explore the range of motion of each client's unique body, where I aim to care for the areas of concern for the individual. It really is a distinct style of massage therapy. I believe after one treatment, you will be <a href="/contact">hooked!</a></p>
