			<p>My massage therapy business is different than others because I travel to the client's home. There is no need to stress about making it to an appointment on time or driving after receiving a session when you are half asleep. Home visits allow the client to be able to relax, heal, and enjoy something wholesome for an extended period of time.  I know how limited time can be in many people's lives and would love to provide a source of relaxation without the added stress. Whether your an athlete, recoving from an injury, looking to relax or simply enjoy the benefits of massage, this treatment style works for everyone young and old alike.</p>

			<p>Learning that less is more, I provide a mat and a white clean sheet for the client to lie upon. The styles I practice the client receives the massage in loose, comfortable clothing. The focus of my massages are on stretching, muscle compression, Shiatsu points(see Styles page above), and the specific physical concerns of each client. It is important to note that the client remains 100% relaxed while I explore the range of motion of each clients unique body, where I aim to care for the individual blocked areas, it really is a distinct style of massage therapy. I believe after one treatment you will be hooked!</p>
