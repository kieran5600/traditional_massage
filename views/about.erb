		<h2> About Myself </h2 >     


		<p>Using traditional methods of massage therapy that have existed for thousands of years ties me to something rooted. Thai and shiatsu therapy are great because they are principled on medicine by treating muscle groups, acupuncture points, and stretching.</p>

		<p>I am a National and New York State licensed Massage Therapist. I am proud to have graduated from the Finger Lakes School of Massage (<a href ="http://www.flsm.com/">F.L.S.M</a>) in Ithaca NY. The education I received at F.L.S.M. was integrative, comprehensive, and compelling and has contributed largely to my success as a therapist today.</p>

		
		<p>I have been practicing massage therapy for nine years. I have spent five years of my career working at a five star resort called The Lodge at Woodloch, perfecting my skills as a massage therapist.  I have developed a strong bodywork practice with Shiatsu, Thai massage, Reflexology, Trager, and Reiki energy work.  I have selected to practice the styles above because they simply work the best and offer matchless long-term benefits. In addition to my typical practice, I am also trained in Connective Tissue Therapy, Swedish, Deep Tissue, Cryo-Therapy, and others. </p>
		
		<p>Massage therapy is a life long pursuit for myself however I am also currently continuing my pursuit for knowledge at the University of New Paltz. I am studying Geo-Chemical Geology and Mathematics/computers. My major interests include water quality, fractals, and computer programming, and web-design. With my interests in massage, art, math, science, language, engineering, and nature I for see many possibilities in my future. This website itself is a product of my education into webdesign/computer programming, that I have built myself.  If interested a website or massage please <a href="/contact">contact</a> myself. I also like to thank <a href ="http://www.jvt.io/"> Joseph Torreggiani </a> for inspiring me and offering sound advice on making a quality web page.   And Thank you for stop by!</p>
